poem = "I wanted to write a line that made a verse, but all it did was make me terse\
Want to put my words down on the screen, but they don't get what I mean\
I want so much but I hardly see, All I want is to be happy with me\
Love only saves you if it comes from you, that's the only love that's true\
So now take sail and move on with pride, some may walk, now we stride"

        "From this point I vow to live, rather than take I'll see what I can give" \
        "To waste a day, just sit and pray for someone to come show you the way" \
        "back straight and chin high, time to sigh is when you die"\
        "If everyone does it, they call it tright, but surely that don't make it right"\
        "for all the days I am around, a deeper meaning may be found"\
        "living to learn as we learn to live, some things we earn but what can I give?"\
        "clever with words or sharp with wit, how does one find the right fit"\
        "for all those lost and filled with doubt, " \
        "fear not the future, plan your route"\
